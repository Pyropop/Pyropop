# Bla Bla, Now I'm trying to make use of Markdown in my musings:
I'm a norwegian who's trying to learn programming on the side of my studies to become a library and information science professional,
as I do love how humans retain, store and make sense of data into information which eventually leads
us into increasing our knowledge about a given subject. Both the facts that everything seems to be 
infintisimally deep and infinitely broad, where both systems work within similar rules and while the individual may seem unique,
you're never as alone as you believe yourself to be as even the outliers move in expected ways, 
if you take a wide/long enough lens to see from that perspective. Obviously within our individual life lies 
we're somewhat hermeneutically "sealed" from grasping the higher impulses and how we're being "drawn" to various "obvious" paths.
> I'm *emphatic* _with_ how extraordinarily I find this __strong *realization*__.
### Alas I don't know how to continue waxing so I'm back to being uneventful~~ly wrong~~:

| Language        | Grasp           | Where to go:  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Bash, shell, regex, vim and such      | Bit more then novice | I passed [This](https://regexlearn.com/) one fine, and it's useful to go back to. Else I've used it a bit in python, and while trying to convert an XML book to MD |
| Python      | novice      | Read some books, done some tasks, but feels like I don't *get* it. |
| Assembly | beginner      | I realize a 4 bite stack is aligned oppositely between ARM and x86, I'm viewing some of the earliest movies by [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelTV) and also found [Hacker's Delight](https://doc.lagout.org/security/Hackers%20Delight.pdf) on like the 4th google result. (I hope that's alright) |
| C | beginner | I borrowed C primer Plus for 2 weeks, but feels insufficient and will have to dedicate more time to it. |
| HTML, CSS & JS | novice | Done a few [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) courses, but without having a website of my own to set up as like a hobby project, I'm not sure I can advance here. While it may be fun to ask for like a present. |
| Ruby, Rust, Go, Java, Zig | I've heard them referenced | Watching [The Primagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) I think I've heard them referenced, but I don't really learn any more from *edutainment* as I do from *pop-science*, though it's interesting to learn more about **the industry** as a whole though. |


## Addendumage
> I also keep a **personal _vault of unnecessary information_** which contains stuff like [this](https://bit.ly/40WytFl), from silly D&D games or w/e which I'm never certain what to make of since it certainly isn't the first time, (it's only the first time I figured I'd make a bit.ly link), and I believe someone else deserves to have these *distractions* from doing proper work as well. ðŸ¤ª

Obviously take it with a pinch of salt, if reading *illusions of controlled narratives* worries or sophistry being BS is foreign to you, maaaybe skip. ðŸ˜‰
