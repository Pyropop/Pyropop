> I'm a norwegian who's trying to learn programming on the side of my studies to become a library and information science professional, as I do love how humans retain, store and make sense of data into information which eventually leads us into increasing our knowledge about a given subject. Both the facts that everything seems to be infintisimally deep and infinitely broad, where both systems work within similar rules and while the individual may seem unique, you're never as alone as you believe yourself to be as even the outliers move in expected ways, if you take a wide/long enough lens to see from that perspective. Obviously within our individual life lies we're somewhat hermeneutically "sealed" from grasping these higher impulses and how we're being "drawn" to various "obvious" paths.
