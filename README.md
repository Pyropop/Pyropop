### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Modus Operandi
I lack experience with programming, but over time I've come to terms with me apperently exhuding 'technical guy' energy.
So where I used to have 'psychology' as a hobby, where I've broken down the different parts and discovered the various 'essences',
which obviously left a deconstructed 'shell' of a being, but I'm atleast 'exploring' a different field now with a different
distraction. There's TOO many languages and I'm probably being 'inefficient' when I just shuffle what 'code' catches my fancy and
I try to understand, but as fragmented my mind categorises points of internalization, I'm just as likely to remember some 'odd' detail
I didn't understand at the point of attainment, but over time as I internalize something completely different and discover a greater depth,
the 'odd' detail can seem integral to this 'wider' field of knowledge, as I just thought it sounded 'french' or something.
## Greener Pastures
I've decided to get a handle on things beyond the silly microcosm of the 'human experience', so now I apply my fragmented mind to a
general understanding of 'computers', but programming in particular, but like I mentioned it feels slow to read the first chapter in Ruby, Python,
Rust, C, Bash, Javascript-providers(?), HTML/CSS/JS, MD, SQL, LSQL, MongoDB, C++, FORTRAN, Hercules, Perl +++
The point being, I'm trying to find some structured courses, I usually get disinterested before exams, but then it's because I've either learned
what I wanted or found the environment stifling, I mean aslong as they don't 'personalize' their presentation, I usually listen to everyone intently
as I try to respect everyone having a lot more knowledge then me when it comes to stuff in the 'external'. If you try to personalize you look like
a child having babys first epiphany and my respect diminishes, I mean... Well you get how I can find myself in a social class and just refuse to internalize 
any of the bile coming out of the 'idols' mouth.
